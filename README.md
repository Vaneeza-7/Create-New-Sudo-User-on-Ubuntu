# Create-New-Sudo-User-on-Ubuntu

This repository contains the shell script to create a new user and give admin rights to that user. You can modify the name of the sudo user as per your requirements.
Once a sudo user is created, the system prompts you to give a password, name, and other credentials.

NOTE: All the commands are written inside functions. You only need to clone the repository and run the shell script in terminal.
